## Introduction to MiniGPT
A PyTorch re-implementation of GPT, both training and inference. minGPT tries to be small, clean, interpretable and educational, as most of the currently available GPT model implementations can a bit sprawling. GPT is not a complicated model and this implementation is appropriately about 300 lines of code (see mingpt/model.py). All that's going on is that a sequence of indices feeds into a Transformer, and a probability distribution over the next index in the sequence comes out. The majority of the complexity is just being clever with batching (both across examples and over sequence length) for efficiency.

## Attention Is All You Need
### Key Components of the GPT Model

MiniGPT is an implimentaion of how to construct a transformer model from scrach and how much computation power is required for generation human under standable output. 

### 1. Tokenization
- Splits input text into tokens (words, subwords, or characters) and converts them into embeddings.
- Captures semantic relationships among tokens, enabling context-aware text generation.

### 2. Positional Encoding
- Adds positional information to token embeddings using sine and cosine functions.
- Retains sequence order information for better context understanding.

### 3. Self-Attention Mechanism
- Assigns attention scores to tokens, focusing on the most relevant context for each word.
  - **Query (Q)**: Represents the current token.
  - **Key (K)**: Represents the context tokens.
  - **Value (V)**: Provides the relevant information.

### 4. Multi-Head Attention
- Uses multiple attention heads to learn diverse relationships in the data.
- Outputs are concatenated and transformed for rich contextual understanding.

### 5. Feed-Forward Network
- Processes outputs from the attention layer through fully connected layers for complex transformations.

## Validation loss grph for the GPT

### 1.Scalability
Parallel processing and self-attention allow GPT to scale effectively for large datasets.
### 2.Contextual Understanding
Attention mechanisms dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input, enabling the model to understand long-term dependencies.
### 3.Transfer Learning
GPT is pre-trained on large corpora to learn general language patterns and fine-tuned on specific tasks, making it highly versatile.
